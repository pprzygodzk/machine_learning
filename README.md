# machine_learning

This repository contains two exercise files for numpy & os libraries.
There's also a project based on machine learning named 'Explosion'.

**The essence of the problem:** there are N sensors evenly spread out on the surface of the earth (in our project we assume a two dimensional earth). There is an explosion point inside the earth and we want to estimate where it could happen based on the measurements from sensors.

(for more information: read "Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning", David Barber, Example 1.12 (Explosions). p. 44)
